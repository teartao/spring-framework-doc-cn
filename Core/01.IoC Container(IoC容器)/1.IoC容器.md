### 1.1. Introduction to the Spring IoC Container and Beans

This chapter covers the Spring Framework implementation of the Inversion of Control (IoC) principle. IoC is also known as dependency injection (DI). It is a process whereby objects define their dependencies (that is, the other objects they work with) only through constructor arguments, arguments to a factory method, or properties that are set on the object instance after it is constructed or returned from a factory method. The container then injects those dependencies when it creates the bean. This process is fundamentally the inverse (hence the name, Inversion of Control) of the bean itself controlling the instantiation or location of its dependencies by using direct construction of classes or a mechanism such as the Service Locator pattern.

The `org.springframework.beans` and `org.springframework.context` packages are the basis for Spring Framework’s IoC container. The [`BeanFactory`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.23/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/BeanFactory.html) interface provides an advanced configuration mechanism capable of managing any type of object. [`ApplicationContext`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.23/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationContext.html) is a sub-interface of `BeanFactory`. It adds:

- Easier integration with Spring’s AOP features
- Message resource handling (for use in internationalization)
- Event publication
- Application-layer specific contexts such as the `WebApplicationContext` for use in web applications.

In short, the `BeanFactory` provides the configuration framework and basic functionality, and the `ApplicationContext` adds more enterprise-specific functionality. The `ApplicationContext` is a complete superset of the `BeanFactory` and is used exclusively in this chapter in descriptions of Spring’s IoC container. For more information on using the `BeanFactory` instead of the `ApplicationContext,` see the section covering the [`BeanFactory` API](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-beanfactory).

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container. Otherwise, a bean is simply one of many objects in your application. Beans, and the dependencies among them, are reflected in the configuration metadata used by a container.

### 1.2. Container Overview

The `org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` interface represents the Spring IoC container and is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans. The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading configuration metadata. The configuration metadata is represented in XML, Java annotations, or Java code. It lets you express the objects that compose your application and the rich interdependencies between those objects.

Several implementations of the `ApplicationContext` interface are supplied with Spring. In stand-alone applications, it is common to create an instance of [`ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.23/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.html) or [`FileSystemXmlApplicationContext`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.3.23/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/FileSystemXmlApplicationContext.html). While XML has been the traditional format for defining configuration metadata, you can instruct the container to use Java annotations or code as the metadata format by providing a small amount of XML configuration to declaratively enable support for these additional metadata formats.

In most application scenarios, explicit user code is not required to instantiate one or more instances of a Spring IoC container. For example, in a web application scenario, a simple eight (or so) lines of boilerplate web descriptor XML in the `web.xml` file of the application typically suffices (see [Convenient ApplicationContext Instantiation for Web Applications](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#context-create)). If you use the [Spring Tools for Eclipse](https://spring.io/tools) (an Eclipse-powered development environment), you can easily create this boilerplate configuration with a few mouse clicks or keystrokes.

The following diagram shows a high-level view of how Spring works. Your application classes are combined with configuration metadata so that, after the `ApplicationContext` is created and initialized, you have a fully configured and executable system or application.
